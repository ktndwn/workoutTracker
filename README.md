# Workout Tracker
This project was created for my portfolio, I wanted a project to practice React.
It's a workout tracker which you can use to tracker your daily workouts. 
It calculates calories burned based on your age, weight, gender as well as the intensity and duration of the workout added.
The formula used can be found [here](http://fitnowtraining.com/2012/01/formula-for-calories-burned/).
