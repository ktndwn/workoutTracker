# Workout Tracker
This project was created for my portfolio, I wanted a project to practice React.
It's a workout tracker which you can use to track your daily workouts. 
It calculates calories burned based on your age, weight, gender as well as the intensity and duration of the workout added.

The formula used can be found [here](http://fitnowtraining.com/2012/01/formula-for-calories-burned/) and [here](http://www.calories-calculator.net/Calculator_Formulars.html), but it might be wrong as it shows women burning more calories for the same workout than males.
I've taken the male formula and added a .75 modifier for the female formula. I never said I was a scientist.
